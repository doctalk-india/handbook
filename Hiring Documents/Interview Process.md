# Interview Process

### Methodology
* Initial call to introduce DocTalk and get to know them at a basic level. Evaluate whether they are very inquisitive about DocTalk and ask a lot of questions.
* Send Programming/Design Task.
* Conduct Live Coding/Design Interview.
* Reference Checks. (3 curated = people they worked with, 3-5 non-curated = linkedin / other professional networks)
* Evaluate Culture Fit:
    * What are your career goals?
	(If his/her goals sound like an echo of the _____ website or they don’t have any, screen them out.)
    * What are you really good at professionally?
	(Push them to give you 8-12 positives, with examples, so that you can build a complete picture of their capabilities. You are listening for strengths.)
    * What are you not good at or not interested in doing professionally?
	(Push them for real weaknesses, 5-8 of them. If they don’t respond thoroughly enough, call them on it. If they still don’t, then say the following:  “If you advance to the next step in our process, we will ask for your help in setting up reference calls with your bosses, peers and subordinates. What do you think they will say are some things that you are not good at, or not interested in?“)
    * Who were your last 3 bosses, and how will they each rate your performance on a 0-10 scale when we talk to them?
    (Press for details of why each person would give them such a rating. We are looking for consistent 8-10s. A 6 is actually a 2. But ask why it’s a 6.)	
    * If you had just 1 year left to live, would you still work with us?

    And then it is important to go deeper. Throughout the interview, get curious. Ask follow-up questions that start with “What”, “How” or “Tell me more.”

    Examples:
    * “What do you mean?”
    * “What is an example of that?”
    * “How did you do that?”
    * “How did that feel?”
* Fly them in for an in person 1 day coding session.

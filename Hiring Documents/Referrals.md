# Referrals
Referrals from people who already work at DocTalk are one of the best signals we can get about whether or not a candidate will be successful at DocTalk. DocTalk employees understand DocTalk’s needs and what it’s like to work at DocTalk, and their relationship with the candidate means they know a lot more than we can learn during an interview process.

For this reason, we have made it mandatory to fill in one referral every week [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XZz7m42DP0edTJTfdjPJC69oGJn33X4gW6cy7bqyKlM/edit#gid=0).
This need not always be someone you know. It can be someone you admire or wish to work with.

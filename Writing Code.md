### Architecture
 * Follow MVVM, no excuses. Code reviews will be harsh otherwise.

### Testing
 * Test all firebase events used for each feature after finishing the feature. Make sure they add up.
 * Test in different scenarios. Here are some - bad network connection, network switching, background, foreground, killed, interrupted (by a call, etc.), low memory, older platform versions, first load in bad network, first load after update, no subscription, subscription inactive, subscription active

### Code Style
 * Make sure swiftlint gives 0 warnings.

### Git
 * Commit everyday and push everyday.
 * Never push to develop or master. Work on your feature branches and submit pull requests.

### Contribute!!
 * Contribute to this document when you have time, let's make it quite comprehensive.

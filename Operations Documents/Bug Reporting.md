# Bug Reporting

All bug reporting goes through the Quality Assurance (QA) engineer.

## Bugs through employees/users

* Once a bug is identified, the QA engineer is to be notified by phone call. (If the QA engineer is unavailable, for e.g. on Sundays or holidays, reach out to Krishna or Vamsee).
* The person reporting the bug also has to describe the priority of the bug and the time sensitivity.
* As soon as a bug is reported, the QA engineer is responsible for reproducing the problem and attaching stack traces, screenshots and any additional information required for debugging the problem.
* The documented bug is added to our bug tracker, which will be taken up based on its impact by the engineers.
* We should always aim to be at 0 bugs!!

## Bugs through Crashlytics & Sentry

* The QA engineer is responsible for tracking all the bugs that pop up on crashlytics & sentry.
* When a bug is reported on crashlytics or sentry, the QA engineer tries to replicate the bug and attaches all relevant stack traces, screenshots, etc and creates a bug on JIRA with a complete description.
* It is the responsibility of the QA engineer to assign the priority of the bug based on number of users affected, number of crashes and severity of the bug.

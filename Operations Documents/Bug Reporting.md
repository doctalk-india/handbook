# Bug Reporting

All bug reporting goes through the Quality Assurance (QA) engineer.

* Once a bug is identified, the QA engineer is to be notified by phone call. (If the QA engineer is unavailable, for e.g. on Sundays or holidays, reach out to Krishna or Vamsee).
* The person reporting the bug also has to describe the priority of the bug and the time sensitivity.
* As soon as a bug is reported, the QA engineer is responsible for reproducing the problem and attaching stack traces, screenshots and any additional information required for debugging the problem.
* The documented bug is pushed to JIRA, which will be taken up by either Krishna or Vamsee until it fills up their buffer time of 40 hrs per PL each.
* If bugs exceed the buffer time, then they will be taken into consideration in the next PL after being put through the prioritization process.

### <a name="length-points"></a>Length and Points
A new Product Lifecycle (PL) starts on every second Monday and lasts for 14 days. During these 14 days, every team member will have tasks assigned to them on JIRA that are worth 100 points. It is extremely important that these 100 points are completed. Each team member is accountable for completing their points.

### <a name="pl-discussion"></a>PL Discussion
Every second Friday, we will have a Pre-PL Discussion at 6PM.  
The agenda for this discussion is as follows:  
* Take the backlog from JIRA and add it to our [**prioritization sheet**](https://docs.google.com/a/getdoctalk.com/spreadsheets/d/1JZkhymaoFsaGT_lB9M8qL1_KQOtEQP9xFTRhIsD_Mac/edit?usp=sharing).
* Brainstorm and score the features.
* Take the top x priorities based on number of team members and their effort score.
* Break these down into subtasks where each subtask should ideally take less than 5 points of work to complete. 
    * The points should reflect any and all work related to that sub task. Ex: discussing implementation, testing, research, etc.
    * When calculating the points per sub task, we will usually ask the person with most expertise in that area to provide an estimate.

### <a name="pl-progress-discussion"></a>PL Progress Discussion
Every other Friday, either Vamsee or Krishna will have a short discussion about progress with every team member.
The agenda for this discussion is as follows:
* Check if everything is on track.
* If it is not, figure out how to get it back on track.

### <a name="pl-task-assignment"></a>PL Task Assignment
Every second Saturday, we will have a PL Discussion at 6PM.  
The agenda for this discussion is as follows:
* Assign sub tasks to team members up to 100 points per team member.
* Set clear expectations.

### <a name="releases"></a>Releases
Vijay will be in charge of Android releases so will only be assigned 90 points per PL.
Sourav will be in charge of iOS release and so will only be assigned 90 points per PL.
The other 10 should go towards ensuring a smooth and timely release.

### <a name="buffer"></a>Buffer
Vamsee will have a 25 point buffer to react to bug fixes and very high priority feature requests.
Krishna will have a 25 point buffer to react to bug fixes and very high priority feature requests.
This will ensure overall team accountability while enabling other team members to stay focused on their respective tasks without facing any interruptions.

### <a name="length-points"></a>Length and Points
A new Product Lifecycle (PL) starts on every second Monday and lasts for 14 days. During these 14 days, every team member will have tasks assigned to them on JIRA that are worth 90 points. It is extremely important that these 90 points are completed. Each team member is accountable for completing their points.

### <a name="releases"></a>Releases
Releases will happen on the 1st Wednesday of a PL after thorough testing.
Vishesh will be in charge of Android releases so will only be assigned 80 points per PL.  
Sourav will be in charge of iOS release and so will only be assigned 80 points per PL.  
The other 10 should go towards ensuring a smooth and timely release.

### <a name="pl-progress-discussion"></a>PL Progress Discussion
On the 1st Saturday, Krishna will have a short discussion about progress with every team member.
The agenda for this discussion is as follows:
* Check if everything is on track.
* If it is not, figure out how to get it back on track.

### <a name="pl-discussion"></a>PL Discussion & Setup
The agenda for this discussion is as follows:  
* Take the backlog from JIRA and add it to our [**prioritization sheet**](https://docs.google.com/a/getdoctalk.com/spreadsheets/d/1JZkhymaoFsaGT_lB9M8qL1_KQOtEQP9xFTRhIsD_Mac/edit?usp=sharing).
* Brainstorm and score the features.
* Take the top x priorities based on number of team members and their effort score.
* Proceed to make spec sheets for every feature we are implementing in the next PL.
* Estimate the time taken to complete each feature by breaking it down into subtasks. Each subtask should ideally take less than 5 points of work to complete. 
    * The points should reflect any and all work related to that sub task. Ex: discussing implementation, testing, research, etc.
    * When calculating the points per sub task, we will usually ask the person with most expertise in that area to provide an estimate.

### <a name="buffer"></a>Buffer
Every team member will have a buffer to work on bugs and other important requests that are not anticipated.

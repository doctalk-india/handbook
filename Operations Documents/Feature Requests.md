# Feature Requests

All feature requests go through the Quality Assurance(QA) engineer.

* When a doctor or a patient requests a new feature, the QA engineer is to be notified by phone call. (If the QA engineer is unavailable, for e.g. on Sundays or holidays, reach out to Krishna or Vamsee).
* The person reporting the feature also has to describe the urgency of the feature and mention who asked for the feature (only if it was a doctor).
* This is then documented on JIRA as a new feature and all the above details are attached along with the number of times the same feature has been requested.
* New feature requests will not be taken up in the current PL. They will be added to our backlog and taken up based on our prioritization process.

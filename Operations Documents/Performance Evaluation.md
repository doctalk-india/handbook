# Performance Evaluation

### Daily Standups
Do the daily standups! If you don't do them then we have no idea about the obstacles you are facing. We give you the opportunity to let us know about these obstacles up front so that we can work through them together to meet deadlines. If you don't do daily standups and further end up missing deadlines, there is not much we can do to help you. On the other, if you do daily standups we can intervene early and help as much as possible.

### Meeting Deadlines (reviewed every pl)

### Git Prime (reviewed every pl)

* Productive Code Throughput > 3k

We will try have these stats up in our office to have some healthy competition going :)

### Quality of Code Reviews (reviewed every month)
Be critical. We should always hold ourselves to high standards and aim to be better developers.
The code reviewer will be held accountable for any bugs that could have been spotted during a code review.

## Bad Performance

* <60 points on JIRA in a PL.
* <80 points on JIRA for 3 PLs in a row.
* Git Prime requirements not met for 2 PLs in a row.

If you are ever performing badly, we're here to support you and get you back on track as long as you are proactive about improving. If bad performance persists then we will be forced to take action as we see appropriate.

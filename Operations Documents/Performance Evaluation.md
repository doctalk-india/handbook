# Performance Evaluation

### Daily Standups
Do the daily standups! If you don't do them then we have no idea about the obstacles you are facing. We give you the opportunity to let us know about these obstacles up front so that we can work through them together to meet deadlines. If you don't do daily standups and further end up missing deadlines, there is not much we can do to help you. On the other, if you do daily standups we can intervene early and help as much as possible.

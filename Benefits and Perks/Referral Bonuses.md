# Referral Bonuses
We offer referral bonus for any new hire that comes from an employee referral to help align company incentives with individual incentives. The bonus amount is equivalent to the 1 month salary of the hired candidate.

All software engineering employees (except the founders) are eligible for the referral bonus. The referral date can’t be earlier than the date the job is posted and the hiring of the referred employee has to happen within 180 days (six months) of the initial referral. The referral must represent the candidate’s first contact with DocTalk, and only the first employee to refer a candidate can get the bonus. The referrer should send the candidate’s information to Krishna, should make an introduction to the candidate, and should expect to be engaged during the recruiting and interview process. The referring employee must still be employed by DocTalk during the hired candidate’s first 30 days of employment, and will be paid within 90 days of the referred employee’s first day. Any disputes or interpretations of this program should be sent to Krishna.
